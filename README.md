# Objective

In this checkpoint, we are going to create our first class-based component and we are going also to create our first state.

## Instructions

- Create a project using create-react-app.
- Transform the App.js into a class-based component.
- Implement a state for this class containing a Person ={ fullName,bio, imgSrc, profession} and a boolean shows.
- Add a button that toggles the show state. When the show state is true, the person's profile will appear.
- Create a field that shows the time interval since the last component was mounted using the component lifecycle.

- Hint: use the setInterval method.
